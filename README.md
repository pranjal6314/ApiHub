## 🛡️ Features

The key features of API Hub W include:
- Rate Limited API routes ⏳
- Protection of sensitive routes 🔒
- Google Authentication 🔑
- A complete API key system to create & revoke user keys 🔑

Additionally, the application boasts a visually appealing UI, thanks to the use of Radix UI Primitives,
Tailwind CSS, fonts from next/font, and icons from Lucide. The dark mode, 
powered by next-themes, enhances the user experience further.


## 💡 Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project, API Hub, came from the need for a centralized interface that allows users to obtain API keys easily and perform various tasks with different input formats. We wanted to create a platform that provides historical data tracking, triggers, and API invocation counts, empowering users to generate unique results and gain valuable context for their API usage.

## 📌 About the Product

API Hub  is a feature-rich web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and Planetscale. It serves as a centralized portal for managing API keys and provides several essential functionalities to enhance the API usage experience.

## 🤔 What it does do?

API Hub  offers the following key features:

- Rate Limited API routes to control the number of requests made to the API.
- Protection of sensitive routes to secure critical endpoints from unauthorized access.
- Google Authentication for users to log in securely using their Google accounts.
- Typescript for type safety and enhanced code maintainability.
- A complete API key system to create and revoke user keys for accessing different APIs.

The project also leverages Radix UI Primitives, Tailwind CSS, fonts from next/font, and icons from Lucide to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. It offers a beautiful dark mode powered by next-themes for added convenience.

Additionally, various tailwindcss plugins like tailwind-merge, tailwindcss-animate, clsx for conditional classes, and class-variance-authority for handling variants are utilized to streamline the UI development process.

## ⚒️ How we built it?

### Frontend

The front end of API Hub  is developed using Next.js, a powerful React framework known for its server-side rendering capabilities and excellent developer experience. TypeScript is employed to catch type-related errors early and improve code maintainability.

### Backend

For the backend, we utilized Prisma, an efficient and type-safe ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool. Prisma simplifies database interactions and ensures data consistency and security.

### Security

Security is a top priority for API Hub. We have implemented rate limiting on API routes to prevent abuse and protect the server from excessive requests. Sensitive routes are safeguarded to ensure that only authorized users can access critical endpoints. Google Authentication is implemented to provide a secure and seamless login experience.

## 📚 What we learned

Throughout the development of API Hub, our team gained valuable insights into building complex web applications. We deepened our understanding of Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and Planetscale while integrating various UI libraries and tailwindcss plugins to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional interface.


### Revenue Streams 💰

The project provides opportunities for potential revenue streams, such as offering premium features or subscription plans for advanced API usage or enhanced support.
